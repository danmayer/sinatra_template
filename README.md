Sinatra Template
===

This is a Sinatra template starter project that has bootstrap and Jquery setup. This is just basically a personal template and won't be trying to support a bunch of configurable use cases

__To Run Locally__

`bundle exec rackup -p 3000`

__TODO__

  * Provide better instructions on what to rename and redo
  * Instructions for getting running with Heroku
  * Opposed to generating a sinatra app have the ability to generate a static site
  * Generator should go through and rename things in the initial templates / ReadMe file like the title / header etc
