Sinatra Template
===

This is a Sinatra template starter project that has bootstrap and Jquery setup. This is just basically a personal template and won't be trying to support a bunch of configurable use cases

__To Run Locally__
`bundle exec thin -R config.ru start`

__TODO__

  * Provide better instructions on what to rename and redo
  * Instructions for getting running with Heroku
