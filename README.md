Sinatra Template
===

This is a Sinatra template starter project that has bootstrap and Jquery setup. This is just basically a personal template and won't be trying to support a bunch of configurable use cases

## To Run Locally

`bundle exec rackup -p 3000`

## TODO

  * Provide better instructions on what to rename and redo
  * Instructions for getting running with Heroku
  * Opposed to generating a sinatra app have the ability to generate a static site
  * Generator should go through and rename things in the initial templates / ReadMe file like the title / header etc
  * add figaro to manage environment, add application.yml to gitignore
  * split to support sinatra template web and sinatra template API one has bootstrap etc the other is optimized for building api endpoints along with gem clients in there client directory
