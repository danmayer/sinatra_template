SINATRA_TEMPLATE
===

This is a Sinatra template starter project it now contains two templates web and api. The web is optimized to have a front end view, while that api is setup for a quick api only setup with no UI.

* Web template includes bootstrap, Jquery, rack flash, http basic auth, and some base CSS/JS.
* Api template includes https only, gem, and some other helpers for getting going

This is just basically a personal template and won't be trying to support a bunch of configurable use cases, but feel free to use it if you find it helpful

## To clone a project

__webapp__

    rake clone_web project=web_example
    
__api__

    rake clone_api project=api_example

## To Run Examples Locally

__webapp__

    cd web
    bundle exec rackup -p 3000

__api__

    cd api
    bundle exec rackup -p 3000

## TODO

  * Provide better instructions on what to rename and redo
  * Instructions for getting running with Heroku
  * Opposed to generating a Sinatra app have the ability to generate a static site with rake file to upload to S3
  * Generator should go through and rename things in the initial templates / ReadMe file like the title / header etc
  * add figaro to manage environment, add application.yml to gitignore
  * rename all pieces / files of client gem to more appropriate name
